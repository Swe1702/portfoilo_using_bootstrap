# portfoilo_using_bootstrap
 My task is to create a porfolio based on the my previous model using bootstrap and add media queries for different screen displays using bootstrap . I have done the task by adding HTML and CSS in following ways

  HTML:
    1. I changed title names and added div tags,added row,column and container,navbar and different other bootstrap classes.
    2. I added figure,img,alt,p,a tags for adding images and p element for writting content.
    3. I linked nav elements to the specified section.
    4. I linked my last module project to img 1 and second project to image 2. When you click on it my project will open in new page.
    5. I added footer and linked my github and linkedin accounts.

  CSS:
    1. I added css properties for each and every class by stating their types with "." and also add css for tags.
    2. I added width and heigts for the images.
    3. Changed sizes of image,text and containers and aligned them based on their display widths.
    4. Added hover effect for all the 5 images in work container.
    5. Some CSS is inbuilt in bootstap so modified some according to my requirement.
